# Diabetes_prediction 
## Prediction of having diabetes and severity classification analysis using different machine learning algorithms. 
### Objective to create a more accurate early prediction system for diabetes by combining various machine learning techniques.
### Data preprocessing for machine learning models to effectively learn and make accurate predictions.
### Accuracy comparison to predict whether having diabetes using Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, Boosting, and Linear Regression algorithms.
### Classifying of different severity levels of diabetes using the Decision Tree algorithm.
